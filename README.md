# StreamingViewer
The Streaming viewer accepts a Movie Title like "Jaws" and the country code "US" to search via an API I was able to obtain from Rapid API 
This project is personally useful for me because I want to know what streaming services host the movie I'm trying to watch and whether I have to buy or rent the movie. I can also see what the price is going to be.
