# StreamingAvailability
The Streaming viewer accepts a Movie Title like "Jaws" and the country code "US" to search via an API I was able to obtain from Rapid API 

This project is personally useful for me because I want to know what streaming services host the movie I'm trying to watch and whether I have to buy or rent the movie. I can also see what the price is going to be.

I was able to get started with this project by obtaining the API from Rapid API https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability
I also consulted documentation regarding OkHTTP, the HTPP client I used.
I'm currently the only one who maintains and contributes to this project. In the future I have plans to add a UI which I think will make it more appealing to a wider audience.
